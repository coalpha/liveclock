# liveclock

*A death clock in a dead language*

Oh boy, here comes another learning project. This time, I wanted to learn a
language called LiveScript. It's part of the CoffeeScript family and it really
has some good ideas in it. The cascade `..` operator is greatly appreciated and
splats `...` were way ahead of it's time. It reminds me of Haskell with it's
syntax. I don't really think that's a good thing since I don't like Haskell's
syntax too much. During the entire development process, I had to keep the
compiled output on the other side of my screen since it feels like there are so
many damn infix operators. Also, whitespace feels like it matters way more than
it should. I hate significant whitespace but this language really turns it up to
the next level. Don't like the code? Neither do I. This was, however, an
exercise in just getting something usable made without fussing on small details.
